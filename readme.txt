This is the frontend of the proposed sensor - based chess board.
As of now, a functional Chess board has been implemented which allows
1. legal movement
2. killing
3. pawn promotion
4. n_passant 
5.castling(with the limitation that the king is first moved, and then the rook -> which is the rule anyways.)

This code will be revisited time after time and improved. But currently this is the development phase.
